				<h2>Farewell Address</h2>
					<p>Washington's farewell address was significant because of his views on political alliances and political parties. His farewell address is still stated today. According to his address, “It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.” He is warning against permanent alliances, but soon mentions that temporary alliances should only be made in an emergency. He warns against political parties because it could split the nation in half. Washington brings up his own views on the government that influenced some presidents after.</p>
