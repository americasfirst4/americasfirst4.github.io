      		<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>In 1787, the Constitution was signed. After seeing the problems of the Articles of Confederation, delegates from each state met in Philadelphia to edit the Articles of Confederation. Washington was elected to become the convention president. The delegates spent a long time debating and established a government with a system of checks and balances. The problem between state representation was solved by the Great Compromise or the Conneticut Compromise. Nine out of thirteen states ratified the Constitution, but some states felt that the rights of the states and people weren't protected. Soon the amendments or the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution to protect state and people's rights. This led to all thirteen states ratifying the Constitution.</p>
